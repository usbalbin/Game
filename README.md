# [Insert title here]

[Insert title here] is an Open World survival sandbox anventure game. The game is currently in VERY early stages.

### Setting and backstory:
At the year of 2017:ish a deadly biological weapon was released by [probably some pretty bad guys] which killed [some poor peeps]. The victims were buried whereafter [stuff happened and they became zombies]. The zombies then rapidly spread across the continents forcing mankind to its knees. The surviving people then scavenged the diminishing rests of civilization in a hopeless attempt to survive.
	
	
More than a century later almost all remains of the "old world" are gone, buildings and entire cities are in ruins, supplies are long dried out and mankind is almost eradicated. Left is a small diminishing group of people who have survived through the years but are now down to only a handful.
	
However in order to prevent total extinction and try to restore humanity to its former position, the group will have to rethink, stop	trying to live from the "old world" and start from scratch by going back to the Stone Age, working their way forwards from there.
